This Jupyter notebook introduces the basic concepts of nonlinear programming.
With the help of interactive plots, the gradient descent algorithm for optimization, and the penalty method for the incorporation of constraints are explained.
Furthermore, it is shown, how nonlinear programming can be run with the Python-Package `SciPy`.
In the end, we give an outlook to automatic differentiation with the Python package `autograd`.

## How to run with Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ahudde/nonlinear_programming/HEAD?labpath=nonlinear_programming.ipynb)

You can run the notebook on Binder with the following link: [https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ahudde/nonlinear_programming/HEAD?labpath=nonlinear_programming.ipynb](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ahudde/nonlinear_programming/HEAD?labpath=nonlinear_programming.ipynb)

## Running `nonlinear_programming` locally

One way is to install the Python-Anaconda-Distribution (https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).
On top of that, please install the packages `plotly` and `autograd` (by typing `conda install plotly` and `conda install autograd` in the anaconda prompt).

## Start

Download the files `nonlinear_programming.ipynb` and `nonlinear_programming.py` as well as the `.svg`-files in the same folder.
Now, start the jupyter notebook by typing `jupyter notebook` into the anaconda prompt and navigating to the `nonlinear_programming` folder.

Now you can run the cells of the notebook and thus learn about nonlinear programming.
You can run many cells several times, where each time one iteration is shown.
Just try it out.

Have fun learning!
